## Notes

-At first, it was kind of comfortable to code on Xcode for I could drag and drop objects in the viewController scene as I visualized for my app.
-But then the problems come with having to familiarize with a lot of unique functions that Swift bring in. It took me time to look into each new functions.
-Overall, coding "tips" in iOS was a very enjoyable experience as I've never coded using Xcode before and looking forward to do it again.
